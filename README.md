## Introduction

This project is a **multi-platform ecosystem** consisting of **three mobile apps** and a **dashboard** designed to streamline e-commerce operations.  

- **User App**: Allows users to browse shops, add products to a cart (from up to 3 shops), place orders, and track order status (e.g., picked or delivered).  
- **Delivery Crew App**: Enables delivery personnel to view pending orders, pick them up, and mark them as delivered.  
- **Shop Owner App**: Lets shop owners manage products (add/edit/delete), create offers, categorize items, and view sales analytics (e.g., most sold products, monthly/yearly profits) via charts.  
- **Staff Dashboard**: Provides staff members with tools to manage orders, track delivery crews, and register new shops or delivery personnel.  

The system is built to ensure seamless coordination between users, shop owners, delivery crews, and staff, enhancing the overall e-commerce experience.
